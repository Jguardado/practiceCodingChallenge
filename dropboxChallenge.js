//The function gets two parameters, a pattern string and an input string
//The pattern string for example will have a pattern like 'abba'
//The input string will be a string such as 'redbluebluered'
//If the two strings get passed into the function, it should return true, because it follows the pattern
//If the pattern string is 'abba' and input string is 'redredblueblue' it should return false
